## Features

### Navigation Bar

 The navigatior bar resides within the header element along with the company logo. The navigation bar includes three anchor links (Home, Prices, About us.) Each link when clicked, will redirect the user to the relevant html page for that anchor link. For added intuitiveness, CSS styling has been applied to each link to draw attention to that specific element when hovered over, and also clicked on.

 The navigation bar is reponsive and will adjust to viewport sizes from 320px and upwards. The navigation bar also maintains a consitent look and placement across all site html files.

A dropdown menu is also present which a customer may use to select the approxmiate size of their pet. A text area box has also been made for the customer to convey information.

## Design
### Color Scheme

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76518393/233825126-0a62836b-32e4-49dd-8f2a-acf29c4f9afc.png)

For the color scheme i opted for a warm and earthy tone. I felt these naturals theme were more suited to a company that works exclusively with animals. I also believe the down to earth and inviting theme will elicit a more positive emotional response from customers.

<br>

### Typography

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76518393/233825531-c4ea0350-e0f0-4945-9074-36309c9a6d6b.png)


The font styles that I chose for the project are Montserrat (headings) and Mukta (paragraphs.) These styles were selected as they are simple, elegant, and compliment each other well. For font weights, a bolder variant of the Monesterrat was imported to bring additional attention to headings.

<br>

### Imagery

All site imagery (including video) were royalty free, and taken from https://www.pexels.com/

### Wireframes

Below are the wireframes for the index.html file that were drafted prior to beginning the project. The final result is slighly differnet than initially depicted. This is was due to project scope increase.
